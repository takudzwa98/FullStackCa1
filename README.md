# FullStackCa1

All work was done by me and no work shared by other students

Challenges:
Making a new collection proved to be a great challenge. Having to dublicate all the jsx files to a new colloection provided a lot of errors 
that took a while to overcome.
Changing names from cakes to songs.
Linking Api to database

How I overcame challenges:
Looking at previous provided by the lecturer provided some help towards the challenges.
Asking the lecturer questions.
Asking other students how they went about their problems.

Helpful Sources:
I used react-bootsrap page to help me customize my page.
I also used w3 schools to learn some tags i didnt know for css;
I used previous projects which also assisted me in my project.
Youtube Videos.

Overall:
Overall project was difficult enough.It was also time consuming as one piece of code could crash everything so i had 
to be careful.I had to look to look over everything i did.I gradually got the hang of it as i understood what was happening within the code.
